# Maineffect
## Testing so bold, it does not require anything.

Maineffect enables you to write tests faster by helping you easily isolate the test execution path. Instead of requiring modules and their dependencies, Maineffect "parses" the module under test into it's [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) representation.

From there on it one can traverse the tree to **find** functions they intend to test. Private functions, class methods and just about anything can be tested this way.

### Installation

`$ npm install maineffect`


### Quickstart - Example #1

**Parse/Load** the file (Do not require or import). **Find** the function you want to test by name and **CallWith** arguments.

##### math.js

	import log from 'logger'
	
	const add = (a,b) => a + b

##### math.test.js

	const {load} = import 'maineffect'
	const math = load(require.resolve('./math'))

	describe ('math', () => {
	  describe('add', () => {
	    it('should return 2 when called with 1, 1', () => {
		const {result} = math.find('add').callWith(1, 1)
		expect(result).to.equal(2)
	    })
	  })
	})

#### Explanation
Here, we wanted to test the **add** function of **math.js**. Generally we import the file into our test and call **add**. However with Maineffect, we parse the raw file, and find the **add** function. Just like finding a `div` element in the DOM. We then call it with our arguments.

#### Advantages

- We can now test private functions. In math.js above we did not export add.
- We dot care about dependencies in the test. Like above, we don't even have a ``logger`` module installed.

### Quickstart - Example #2
**Provide** a variable with any value. **Fold** stuff you don't care about.

##### taxes.js

	import log from 'Logger'
	import getTaxeRate from 'irs'

	const getAmountAfterTaxes = async (amount) => {
	  log('Inside getTaxes')
	  const taxRate = await getTaxeRate()
	  return amount - amount * taxRate
	}

##### taxes.test.js

	import { expect } from 'chai'
	import { load } from '../src/maineffect'
  
	const taxes = load(require.resolve('./taxes'))

	describe ('taxes', () => {
	  describe('getAmountAfterTaxes', () => {
	    it('should return 50 when called with 100 and a rate of 0.5', async () => {
          const {result} = taxes.find('getAmountAfterTaxes')
                            .provide('log', () => {})					
                            .fold('taxRate', 0.5)
                            .callWith(100)
          expect(await result).to.equal(50)
	    })
	  })
	})

#### Explanation
Here, we want to test the **getAmountAfterTaxes** function of **taxes.js**. Once we ``find`` the function, we ``provide`` **log** as an empty function (stubs also work here). Then we ``fold`` the **taxRate** constant to the value **0.5** and call the function.

#### Advantages
- All we care about is the value of **taxRate**. We are not here to test getTaxeRate. So we **fold** the right-hand-side of that assignment to a value we like.
- We can mock dependencies like **log**
